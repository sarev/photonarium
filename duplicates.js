/**
 * @fileoverview Duplicates detection screen module for the Imaginary application.
 *
 * This module handles the Duplicates screen where users find and manage
 * duplicate or near-duplicate images. It registers with the core App module
 * and provides a specialized view for duplicate group management.
 *
 * RESPONSIBILITIES:
 *
 * Duplicate Detection Levels:
 *   The similarity slider controls the strictness of duplicate matching:
 *   - Level 0 (Identical): Same file size and SHA256 checksum
 *   - Level 1 (Perceptual): Same or very similar perceptual hash
 *     (catches rescaled images, different compression levels)
 *   - Level 2 (Similar): High OpenCLIP embedding cosine similarity
 *     (catches shot sequences, similar compositions)
 *   - Level 3 (Related): Lower OpenCLIP similarity threshold
 *     (catches thematically related images)
 *
 * Stack Display:
 *   - Shows duplicate groups as stacked thumbnail cards
 *   - Each stack shows the "best" image as the top thumbnail
 *   - Stack displays count of images in the group (e.g., "3 images")
 *   - Stacks are sorted by group size (largest groups first)
 *   - Empty state message when no duplicates found at current level
 *
 * Best Image Selection:
 *   The "best" image in each group is determined by:
 *   1. Highest resolution (width × height)
 *   2. Best Laplacian variance score (most in focus)
 *   3. Lossless compression preferred over lossy
 *   This image appears on top of the stack and is pre-selected when
 *   viewing the group in Gallery.
 *
 * Stack Interaction:
 *   - Double-click stack opens Gallery filtered to show only that group
 *   - Gallery pre-selects the "best" image in the group
 *   - Returning from Gallery restores Duplicates scroll position
 *   - Thumbnail size controls (smaller/larger) adjust stack preview size
 *
 * Dynamic Updates:
 *   - Changing similarity slider immediately recomputes and updates display
 *   - Backend provides pre-computed duplicate groups at each level
 *   - Smooth transition animation when groups appear/disappear
 *
 * Performance:
 *   - Duplicate groups are computed on backend during scan
 *   - Frontend caches group data for quick slider changes
 *   - Lazy loads stack thumbnails as they scroll into view
 *
 * LIFECYCLE HOOKS:
 *   - onEnter(): Fetches duplicate groups from backend, renders stacks
 *   - onLeave(): Saves scroll position for restoration on return
